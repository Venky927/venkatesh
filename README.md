🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.
The model can accurately recognize digits (0–9) from handwritten images, including user-uploaded images.


---

📌 Features

Uses MNIST dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 testing images)

Built with TensorFlow / Keras

CNN architecture for high accuracy

Supports custom handwritten digit image input

Trained model saved as .h5 file

Runs smoothly on Google Colab

🧪 Dataset

MNIST Dataset

Grayscale images of size 28×28

Digits from 0 to 9


The dataset is automatically loaded using:

from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist


---

🧠 Model Architecture

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)

Max Pooling Layers

Flatten Layer

Fully Connected Dense Layers

Softmax output layer for classification



---

🚀 How to Run the Project (Google Colab)

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab


2. Run all cells step by step


3. Upload your handwritten digit image when prompted


4. The model predicts the digit




---

🖼️ Custom Image Prediction

Upload your own handwritten digit image

Image will be:

Converted to grayscale

Resized to 28×28

Normalized


Model predicts the digit with high accuracy



---

📊 Model Performance

High accuracy on test data

Confusion matrix used for evaluation

Performs well on both MNIST and custom images



💾 Saved Model

The trained model is saved as:

mnist_cnn_model.h5

You can load it anytime using:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('mnist_cnn_model.h5')


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Google Colab



📌 Future Improvements

GUI using Streamlit or Tkinter

Support for colored images

Mobile/web deployment

Improve accuracy on real-world handwriting
